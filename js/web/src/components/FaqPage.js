            After a one time fee, releases on Nina are permanent. This fee
            handles Solana and {`Arweave's`} transaction and storage cost (~$2.50 + $0.01/MB). Nina takes no additional fees to publish a release. (Currently, all transaction costs for artists are subsidized by Nina)
            The patronage model created between artist and fan serves as a
            platform agnostic mechanism to provide exclusive experiences to
            supporters.

            On Nina, all releases are priced in USDC.  The USDC used on Nina is SPL-wrapped USDC, native to the Solana blockchain.  It is important to make sure that your exchange accepts SPL-USDC.  <a target="_blank" href="www.ftx.us">FTX</a> and <a target="_blank" href="www.binance.us">Binance</a> both accept SPL-USDC (make sure to send to the SPL-USDC address given by your exchange - it should not start with {`"0x"`}).
