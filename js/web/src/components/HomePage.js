          When you publish a release you get to decide the price and edition
          size. Releases are streamable and can be purchased by fans that want
          to support artists directly. Like physical records, fans can resell
          releases in a secondary marketplace, but unlike the physical world you
          automatically get a cut of all resales at whatever percentage you
          determine.

          On Nina artists keep 100% of their profits. When you sell your release
          for $5, you receive $5 each time it is sold. Artists pay a one-time
          publishing fee to set up a release, which covers storage of audio
          files, artwork, metadata and ensures the permanent availability of
          your release. This fee goes to Solana, the network that Nina is built
          on.

            Instead of charging artists a fee to use Nina, we collect 1% of your
            edition (if you publish an edition of 1,000 Nina will receive 10
            copies). We keep these in the Nina Vault, a treasury of all the
            content published on Nina. A 1% fee is also collected from fans at
            the point of sale and sellers on the secondary market. Whereas it
            can take months to be paid by current streaming services, with Nina
            you receive your revenue as soon as a sale occurs.
